# AI Development Log

This document discloses the use of AI-assisted development tools in the creation of the **fmri_first_level_proc** analysis pipeline, in accordance with emerging best practices for transparency in scientific software development.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a structured disclosure of AI tool usage during the development of the fmri_first_level_proc pipeline. The disclosure follows the AI Disclosure (AID) Framework (Weaver, 2025) and adheres to recommendations for responsible AI use in scientific computing (Bridgeford et al., 2025; Nussberger et al., 2024; Jamieson et al., 2024). The intent is to ensure that reviewers, collaborators, and end users can assess the nature and extent of AI involvement in the development process.

## 2. Scope

AI assistance was utilized for **analysis pipeline development**, encompassing:

- Code architecture and design
- Statistical methodology review and validation
- Implementation of pipeline modules
- Test suite development and validation
- Documentation authoring and refinement

AI was **not** used for:

- Running analyses on real data
- Interpreting scientific results from pipeline outputs
- Making domain-specific methodological decisions (e.g., selection of covariates, outcome definitions, or study-specific analytical choices)

fmri_first_level_proc is a general-purpose, pip-installable framework for first-level fMRI analyses (task activation, task connectivity, and resting-state connectivity). The pipeline development activities covered above are distinct from its application to any specific dataset or research question.

## 3. Tools Used

Development utilized **Claude Code** (Anthropic), employing two model tiers:

| Model | Role | Tasks |
|-------|------|-------|
| Claude Opus 4 | Analytical and review | Critical review of statistical methods, brainstorming sessions, code quality audits, risk assessment, and architectural decisions |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | Implementation | Code generation, test implementation, documentation drafting, and file management |

This dual-model approach ensured that analytical depth (Opus) was applied to decisions with statistical or methodological consequences, while implementation efficiency (Sonnet) was used for well-specified coding tasks under explicit human direction.

## 4. Development Workflow

The pipeline was developed through an iterative, mode-based workflow with the following stages:

1. **Brainstorm** -- Structured discussion of design decisions, trade-offs, and alternative approaches. Every brainstorm session produced a report with explicit decision records (accepted, rejected, deferred).

2. **Critical Review (CR)** -- Formal review of the codebase for statistical correctness, robustness, reproducibility, and defensive coding practices. Each finding was classified by severity (P0/P1/P2) and required explicit human triage (accept, reject, or modify).

3. **Implement (Plan + Build)** -- Implementation proceeded in two sub-phases: (a) a technical specification mapping each approved change to specific code modifications with risk assessment, and (b) execution of the specification. All plans required human approval before code generation began.

4. **Test** -- Comprehensive test suite development covering unit, integration, edge-case, and statistical invariant tests. Tests were designed prior to implementation where feasible (test-first methodology).

5. **Document** -- Authoring and updating of user-facing documentation and machine-readable technical specifications.

Key properties of this workflow:

- All decisions required **explicit human approval** before implementation.
- The pipeline was developed with a **test-first** approach.
- Every statistical and algorithmic choice was subjected to **formal critical review**, with findings documented and triaged individually.

## 5. Human Oversight

The researcher maintained full oversight and decision authority throughout the development process:

- **(a)** Defined all statistical methodology and analytical approach, including HRF model selection, motion censoring conventions, connectivity computation strategy, and degrees-of-freedom pre-flight logic.

- **(b)** Triaged every critical review finding with explicit accept/reject/modify decisions, documented in brainstorm reports with rationale for each determination.

- **(c)** Approved all implementation plans (technical specifications) before any code generation was executed.

- **(d)** Validated all test results and ensured test coverage aligned with the statistical guarantees required by the pipeline.

- **(e)** Made all domain-specific decisions regarding pipeline architecture, algorithmic choices (e.g., minimum-outlier EPI via AFNI `3dToutcount`, degrees-only rotation convention, `polort -1` with bandpass), and analytical strategy.

## 6. Audit Trail

A complete record of the structured development process is available in the `.aid/reports/` directory within this repository. The audit trail includes:

- **Brainstorm reports** -- Records of design discussions, decision rationale, and trade-off analyses.
- **Critical review reports** -- Formal findings with severity classifications and human triage decisions.
- **Implementation plans** -- Technical specifications mapping approved changes to code modifications.
- **Implementation build reports** -- Records of executed changes with deviation notes.
- **Test reports** -- Test suite results and coverage summaries.
- **Documentation reports** -- Records of documentation updates and revisions.

The project-level configuration file used to guide AI interactions is preserved as `.aid/project_claude.md`.

Raw session transcripts are excluded for privacy reasons. The structured reports above capture all substantive technical decisions, rationale, and implementation details.

## Version History

- **v2.4.0** (2026-04-03): Added motion derivative degree configuration, mandatory minimum-outlier EPI generation, and optional pre-regression parcellated time series extraction. AID artifacts synced for all development cycles through v2.4.0.
- **v2.4.0-post1** (2026-04-03): Fixed DOF pre-flight check in rest_conn that overestimated regressor count by 3 (stale polort 2 assumption after v2.3.1 changed to polort -1). Updated module docstring and inline comments. Added run_first_level module-level docstring and corrected its version header. Minor signature formatting in first_level_utils.
- **v2.5.0** (2026-05-01): Added sequenced denoising path for resting-state connectivity (`use_sequenced_bandpass`). Implements Ciric et al. 2017 NTRP-interpolation and separate bandpass approach with Hallquist 2013 nuisance-filtering doctrine. New utility functions `censor_interpolate_1d_afni` and `bandpass_filter_1d_afni` added to first_level_utils. Config validation, test suite (55 new tests; 515 total passing), and documentation updated.
