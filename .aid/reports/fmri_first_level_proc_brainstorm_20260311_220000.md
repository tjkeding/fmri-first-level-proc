    <topic id="T1" title="BUG-001: Silent sub-brick ordering mismatch in gen_beta_series()">
      <summary>get_stim_data() accumulates beta onsets in first-appearance order (pandas .unique()), but gen_beta_series() extracts sub-bricks in alphabetical order (np.unique()). The total_used counter assigns wrong sub-brick indices to every condition after the first group. All task_conn condition-specific beta series, connectivity matrices, and contrasts are silently incorrect. Present since initial implementation.</summary>
      <approaches>
        <approach id="A1" label="Return beta_cond_order from get_stim_data (Option A)" feasibility="high" risk="low">
          <description>Have get_stim_data() return the explicit condition accumulation order as a list. Thread this list through gen_beta_series() and gen_design_matrix() so downstream functions use the ground-truth order rather than independently reconstructing it. Eliminates np.unique() from the task_conn pipeline entirely.</description>
          <pros>Makes the ordering contract explicit and testable; eliminates implicit agreement between functions; self-documenting; robust to future edits</pros>
          <cons>Slightly more invasive than Option B (changes function signatures)</cons>
          <statistical_considerations>Silent data corruption is the worst class of bug in neuroimaging — analyses complete "successfully" but every condition label maps to incorrect neural data. Any prior task_conn results from this pipeline must be considered invalid.</statistical_considerations>
        </approach>
        <approach id="A2" label="Alphabetical accumulation in get_stim_data (Option B)" feasibility="high" risk="med">
          <description>Change get_stim_data() line 153 to use np.unique() instead of .unique(), making both functions independently choose alphabetical order.</description>
          <pros>Minimal code change (one line)</pros>
          <cons>Contract remains implicit — both functions must independently choose the same ordering convention; fragile to future edits; no explicit documentation of the dependency</cons>
        </approach>
      </approaches>
      <decision status="decided" chosen="A1">Option A selected. The ordering contract must be explicit. Additionally, np.unique() will be eliminated from gen_design_matrix() line 216 — nuisance condition iteration will use stim_data['CONDITION'].unique() with a filter (preserving first-appearance order throughout). This removes np.unique() from the entire task_conn pipeline, eliminating the class of ordering ambiguity.</decision>

    <topic id="T2" title="BUG-002: Dropped conditions' onset files not written for nuisance regressors">
      <summary>get_stim_data() runs before check_trial_survival() in run(). Conditions in cond_beta_labels at call time get combined into beta_onsets.txt (no individual onset file). After trial survival filtering drops conditions from cond_beta_labels, gen_design_matrix() treats them as nuisance and references individual onset files that were never written. Crashes with "can't read file" on sessions with heavy censoring. Introduced in v2.2.0 by the condition-drop logic.</summary>

        <approach id="A1" label="Reorder: drop before get_stim_data, with double-read" feasibility="high" risk="low">
          <description>Call read_and_validate_stim_data() first (for trial survival check), then call get_stim_data() after condition filtering. The timing CSV is read twice (once for validation/survival, once for onset file writing).</description>
          <pros>Minimal refactor; straightforward</pros>
          <cons>Double-read of timing CSV; get_stim_data() encapsulates both read and write, making the API unclear about what has already been validated</cons>
        </approach>
        <approach id="A2" label="Split get_stim_data into read + write phases" feasibility="high" risk="low">
          <description>Refactor get_stim_data() into two functions: (1) read_stim_data() — reads, validates, and returns the sorted DataFrame; (2) write_stim_onset_files() — writes the onset files based on the current cond_beta_labels. The run() function calls read first, performs trial survival and condition filtering, then calls write with the updated labels.</description>
          <pros>Single read of timing CSV; clear separation of concerns; each function has a single responsibility; the write function explicitly receives the filtered state</pros>
          <cons>Slightly more refactoring; changes the function API (but get_stim_data is internal, not public)</cons>
        </approach>
      </approaches>
      <decision status="decided" chosen="A2">Split get_stim_data() into read + write phases. This provides clean separation of concerns, avoids double-reading the timing CSV, and makes the data flow explicit. The write phase receives the already-filtered cond_beta_labels, so dropped conditions naturally get individual onset files. Composes cleanly with BUG-001 fix — the write phase returns beta_cond_order reflecting only surviving conditions.</decision>

    <topic id="T3" title="BUG-003: notch_filter_motion() 1D dimension misinterpretation by 3dTproject">
      <summary>AFNI interprets .1D files as rows=voxels, cols=timepoints. A 378x6 motion file is seen as 378 voxels x 6 timepoints, causing "fewer than 9 time points" error. The original code used a trailing ' (AFNI transpose) on input, but v2.2.0 removed it to fix a downstream orientation issue. Both states (with/without transpose) fail — the ' is needed for input but the output must be transposed back. Independent of BUG-001/002.</summary>

          <description>Restore ' on input. After 3dTproject, use np.loadtxt + .T + np.savetxt to transpose output back to rows=TRs, cols=params.</description>
          <pros>Self-contained in Python; no additional AFNI dependency</pros>
          <cons>Introduces numpy I/O for a file format that is AFNI-native; potential precision/formatting differences; prior np.savetxt issues in this codebase (compute_matrix_contrast)</cons>

          <pros>AFNI-native; no precision/format conversion; consistent with the rest of the pipeline's tool usage; avoids numpy I/O edge cases</pros>

          <description>Apply 3dTproject to each of the 6 motion columns independently as single-column 1D files, then recombine. No transpose ambiguity.</description>

          <cons>Over-engineered; 6x subprocess overhead; harder to read/maintain</cons>
        </approach>
      </approaches>
      <decision status="decided" chosen="A2">Use AFNI's 1dtranspose on the output. This keeps the entire notch filtering operation within the AFNI ecosystem, avoids numpy I/O format concerns, and is consistent with the pipeline's design philosophy of wrapping AFNI commands rather than reimplementing their functionality in Python.</decision>

    <topic id="T4" title="task_act condition-drop ordering harmonization">
      <summary>task_act_first_level.py calls get_stim_data() before condition dropping (line 505 vs 508-513). For task_act this is harmless because onset files are per-condition and dropped conditions are simply not referenced in 3dDeconvolve. However, the asymmetry creates maintenance risk — a future developer may assume the ordering is safe because "task_act does it this way."</summary>

          <description>Apply the same read/write split pattern to task_act: read timing data first, perform trial survival check and condition filtering, then write onset files with the filtered condition list.</description>
          <pros>Consistent pattern across both pipelines; prevents maintenance errors; makes the data flow identical</pros>
          <cons>Requires touching task_act code that currently works correctly</cons>
