    <failures_summary>All 26 failures share a single root cause: AttributeError on `args.use_sequenced_bandpass` raised by the new dispatch branch in gen_residual_ts. Locally-built rest_conn SimpleNamespace fixtures and the shared make_rest_conn_args fixture predate the v2.5.0 sequenced-denoising additions and do not declare the field. Affected modules: test_cenmode (1), test_censor_creation (3), test_rest_conn_dof_skip (1), test_rest_conn_pipeline (5 base + 5 parametrized), test_tr_explicit (2), test_v240_extract_raw_ptseries (2), test_v240_pipeline_integration (7).</failures_summary>

    <design_rationale>The brainstorm report enumerated six P1 test items; the five new test modules map to those items (utilities are paired in test_sequenced_utils.py since they share the same .1D-orientation contract; the remaining four items each get a dedicated module). The regression item is implemented as a structural-identity check on the dispatched 3dTproject command; a literal bitwise-output check would require live AFNI runs on real fMRI data, which is out of scope for unit tests. All new tests follow the existing make_pipeline_mocks pattern from conftest.py, with one exception: the unit tests for the new 1D-AFNI utilities patch run_afni_command, os.path.exists, and os.replace at the first_level_utils module level so the transpose round-trip can be verified end-to-end without requiring real AFNI binaries on disk. Tests are deterministic (no random seeds because no statistical content is generated; mock inputs are fixed strings). The pre-design run revealed all 26 baseline failures share a single root cause: the addition of use_sequenced_bandpass to the rest_conn args namespace required all rest_conn test fixtures (shared and local) to declare the field. This was resolved during design by adding the field to make_rest_conn_args and to the three locally-built fixtures.</design_rationale>
